Here are the instructions for adding data from new ad platforms into my Marketing Campaign Data Management (MCDM) system:

1. **Identify the Ad Platform**: Determine the specific ad platform from which you want to import data into your MCDM system. This could be platforms like Google Ads, Facebook Ads, Twitter Ads, etc.

2. **Data Access and Permissions**: Ensure that you have appropriate access and permissions to extract data from the ad platform. You may need to work with your ad platform account administrator or obtain necessary API credentials.

3. **Choose Data Integration Method**: Decide on the method of data integration based on the capabilities provided by the ad platform. Common methods include:

   - **API Integration**: Many ad platforms offer APIs that allow programmatic access to their data. Review the API documentation and familiarize yourself with the available endpoints and authentication mechanisms.

   - **Data Export Options**: Some ad platforms provide data export options like CSV, Excel, or other file formats. Determine if the ad platform allows you to export the data you need and understand the export process.

4. **Extract Data**: Depending on the chosen integration method, you will need to extract the required data from the ad platform. Follow these general steps:

   - For API Integration:
     - Set up authentication: Obtain API credentials (e.g., API key, client ID, client secret) and set up authentication to access the API endpoints.
     - Choose the appropriate endpoint: Identify the API endpoint(s) that provide the data you require (e.g., campaign performance, ad spend, impressions).
     - Make API requests: Use the appropriate HTTP methods (GET, POST, etc.) and parameters to retrieve the desired data from the ad platform's API.
     - Handle pagination: If the API response is paginated, make sure to handle pagination to retrieve all the data.
     - Store the extracted data: Save the extracted data in a suitable format, such as CSV, JSON, or a database.

   - For Data Export Options:
     - Export the data: Follow the ad platform's export process to obtain the desired data. This may involve specifying date ranges, metrics, and dimensions.
     - Store the exported data: Save the exported data in a suitable format, such as CSV, Excel, or a database.

5. **Data Transformation**: Once you have extracted the data, you may need to transform it to fit the structure of your MCDM system. Common transformations include cleaning the data, mapping columns to standardized fields, and converting data types.

6. **Load Data into MCDM**: Load the transformed data into your MCDM system. This may involve importing the data into a database, data warehouse, or a specialized marketing analytics tool.

7. **Schedule Regular Updates**: Set up a schedule or automation process to regularly extract and load the data from the ad platform into your MCDM system. This ensures that your data remains up-to-date for analysis and reporting.

8. **Verify and Monitor**: Validate the imported data to ensure accuracy and consistency. Monitor the data feeds regularly to identify any issues or discrepancies and take appropriate actions to address them.

By following these steps, you can add data from new ad platforms into my MCDM system, enabling comprehensive marketing campaign analysis and reporting.
